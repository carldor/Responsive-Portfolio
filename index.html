	 	I am a world traveler who, along with my wonderful girlfriend, has a great appreciation of art and art collecting. During my travels in France, I was exposed to a number of artistic genres and media, as a part of a cultural and linguistic exprerience during the spring of 2010. Although I am fond of art with Haitian, French and Brazilian origins, the local DMV art community overflows with artistic expression.

	 <p id="bio">
	 	In addition to art, I am a lover of music, sports and George, my 1 year old beagle that my girlfriend and I have had for 10 months. From the beats of the islands to the house music originating in Chicago, music speaks to me in the way of a dear friend. Soccer is a passion. And George, well, he's just the cutest puppy you'd ever meet. Bubbling forth with personality, energy, and huministic mannerisms, he's a wonderful source of laughter and a little ray of sushine on the cloudiest days.
